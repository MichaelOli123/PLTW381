# PLTW 3.8.1 2D Arrays

Machine Learning uses linear regression of a multidimensional space to minimize the difference between the predicted outcome and the actual outcome (i.e. training set) by adjusting the edge weights in a graph. Here, we'll learn 2D Arrays to set us up to code a linear regression app. on a simple 2D scatter plot.
